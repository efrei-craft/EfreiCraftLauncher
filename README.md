## Development

This section details the setup of a basic developmentment environment.

### Getting Started

**System Requirements**

* [Node.js][nodejs] v16

---

**Clone and Install Dependencies**

```console
> git clone https://github.com/efrei-craft/EfreiCraftLauncher.git
> cd EfreiCraftLauncher
> npm install
```

---

**Launch Application**

```console
> npm start
```

---

**Build Installers**

To build for your current platform.

```console
> npm run dist
```

Build for a specific platform.

| Platform    | Command              |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Windows x64 | `npm run dist:win`   |
| macOS       | `npm run dist:mac`   |
| Linux x64   | `npm run dist:linux` |

Builds for macOS may not work on Windows/Linux and vice-versa.

---

### Visual Studio Code

All development of the launcher should be done using [Visual Studio Code][vscode].

Paste the following into `.vscode/launch.json`

```JSON
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Debug Main Process",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/electron/cli.js",
      "args" : ["."],
      "outputCapture": "std"
    },
    {
      "name": "Debug Renderer Process",
      "type": "chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron",
      "windows": {
        "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/electron.cmd"
      },
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/.",
        "--remote-debugging-port=9222"
      ],
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  ]
}
```

This adds two debug configurations.

#### Debug Main Process

This allows you to debug Electron's [main process][mainprocess]. You can debug scripts in the [renderer process][rendererprocess] by opening the DevTools Window.

#### Debug Renderer Process

This allows you to debug Electron's [renderer process][rendererprocess]. This requires you to install the [Debugger for Chrome][chromedebugger] extension.

Note that you **cannot** open the DevTools window while using this debug configuration. Chromium only allows one debugger, opening another will crash the program.
